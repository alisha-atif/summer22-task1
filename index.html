<h2>Connecting with Space and Place</h2>
<p1>
  Geography is the study of places and the relationships between people and their 
  environments. Geographers explore both the physical properties of Earth’s surface
  and the human societies spread across it. They also examine how human culture 
  interacts with the natural environment and the way that locations and places can 
  have an impact on people. Geography seeks to understand where things are found, 
  why they are there, and how they develop and change over time.
