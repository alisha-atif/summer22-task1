        Cybercrime refers to any illegal activity carried out  using computers or the
        internet. Cybercriminals — ranging from rogue individuals to organized crime 
        groups to state-sponsored factions — use techniques like phishing, social
        engineering, and all kinds of malware as part of their cyber attacks.

    When you hear the word “cybercriminal” or “
     <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker">hacker
    </a>
    ” what image comes to mind? 
    Is it a sketchy guy, perhaps wearing a dark hoodie, camped out in a dank basement
    somewhere, typing away furiously? While that image is in the public consciousness 
    thanks to movies and TV, the real picture of a cybercriminal is much different: 
    cybercrime is incredibly organized and professionalized.

    The professionalization and proliferation of cybercrime adds up to countless 
    costs in damages every year, impacting individuals, businesses, and even
     governments. Experts estimate that cybercrime damages will reach $6 trillion
      annually by 2021, making it one of the most lucrative criminal enterprises.
